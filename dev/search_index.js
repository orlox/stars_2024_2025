These are the dynamical, thermal and nuclear timescales. Even without knowing the equations of stellar structure and evolution we can do some estimates on the value of these quantities. Compute these without a calculator! We only care about the order of magnitude of these timescales, which given all the approximations done is all we can do. For solar properties, use the following for the mass, radius and luminosity:","category":"page"},{"location":"1_introduction_problems/","page":"Exercises","title":"Exercises","text":"R_odotsim 7times 10^10mathrmcmquad M_odot sim 2times 10^33mathrmgquad L_odot sim 4times 10^33mathrmergs^-1","category":"page"},{"location":"1_introduction_problems/","page":"Exercises","title":"Exercises","text":"Thermal timescale: One of the main early hypothesis to explain the energy source of the Sun was that it originated from its slow contraction into its own gravitational potential. In such a case, a rough estimate of the energy the Sun would have radiated through its life is given by the negative of the gravitational potential energy E_mathrmg:\nE_mathrmg sim displaystyle -fracGM_odot^2R_odot\nAssuming that the luminosity of the Sun has always been its current one, L_odot, compute the age of the Sun under the assumption that it is only powered by contraction.\nDynamical timescale: For most of their lives stars are very close to hydrostatic equilibrium, carefully balancing their gravities against the support of a pressure gradient. Whenever these two forces are misbalanced, the star will evolve in what is known as the dynamical timescale. Estimate this timescale by computing the time it would take for the surface of the sun to free-fall all the way to its center if all forces opposing gravity would be removed. For simplicity assume that the gravitational acceleration is constant and equal to its present one.\nNuclear timescale: As we now know, most stars are powered by nuclear reactions. Masses of isotopes are normally given in terms of the atomic mass unit m_mathrmu=1661times 10^-24mathrmg, defined as 112 of the mass of a carbon-12 atom. The mass of a hydrogen atom is m_mathrmH=1007825m_mathrmu and that of a helium atom is m_mathrmHe=4002602 m_mathrmu, such that if four hydrogen atoms are fused into a helium atom there is a mass deficit leading to a release of energy (4m_mathrmH-m_mathrmHe)c^2sim 4times 10^-5mathrmerg. With this information, estimate the lifetime of the Sun as a core-hydrogen burning star. For simplicity, assume the Sun has a constant luminosity and is entirely composed of hydrogen, 10% of which is burned into Helium during core-hydrogen burning.","category":"page"},{"location":"1_introduction_problems/#Solutions","page":"Exercises","title":"Solutions","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"1_introduction_problems/#:-Timescales-of-stellar-evolution-2","page":"Exercises","title":"1: Timescales of stellar evolution","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"1_introduction_problems/","page":"Exercises","title":"Exercises","text":"asdasd","category":"page"},{"location":"1_introduction_julia/#Julia-setup","page":"Julia setup","title":"Julia setup","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"1_introduction_julia/","page":"Julia setup","title":"Julia setup","text":"This class will include computational examples that are programmed in the julia programming language.
